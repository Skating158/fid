<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Pet Rescue Organization (or PRO), in this volunteer-freindly organization our job is to successfully rescue and manage the safety of any and all animals belonging to their respectful owners. Whether they are lost, injured, or abused; our job will be to keep them from harms way and return them to their owners. If they do not belong to any owners or are the victims of abuse then we will keep them safe in our rehabilitating and adoption facilites, where they will be treated with the utmost respect and love that our fellow associates can offer.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Our main goal is to rescue, protect, and manage any pets involved in all situations, whether they are environmental catastrophes such as floods and storms, missing from their homes and families, victims of both physical and neglective abuse, or suffering any type of injuries. Then we'll be there to rescue them and return them safely back to thier families (or new loving families if they are not associated with any).</p>

<h2>Rehabilitation</h2>
<p>Our modern rehabilitation/medical facilities will be responsible in providing immediate medical and psychological attention to any animals who have been injured. Our professional veterenarians will stand by ready to treat all injured animals brought back during the rescue mission and will be treated with the highest quality medical care that we provide. Our licensed trainers will be involved in rehabiliting and assisting any animals involved in any horrifying environmental disasters or victimized in the presence of abuse by their past owners; loving care and attention will be provided to all of these animals in order to provide them with maximum comfort and a stress-free environment.

<h2>Volunteer Opportunites</h2>
<p>The majority of our organization is made up of the hundreds of volunteers working to provide these rescued animals with a better life. As a volunteer you can assist in on-site rescue missions alongside professionally licensed and veteran rescue workers, you may also qualify in volunteering in our rehabilitation/medical centers, where you will become a trainer who will help renew the bonds between man and pet under the supervision of professional trainers.</p>

<h2>Donations</h2>
<p>If you would like to make a difference and assist our organization in furthering its goal to rescuing and managing all pets, than please feel free to provide a donation to our organization. Every penny helps and we would very much appreciate the time you take in to providing us with your support, so that we may continue our efforts in the rescue and safeguard of any and all animals from the harsh conditions that the world has to throw at them.

<h2>Adoptions</h2>
<p>Here in our organization we provide many animals with the opportunity to meet a new family; where they can be treated with love, care, and a safe place to call home. Many of our rescued wildlife are homeless and without families go back to, therefore it is our job to provide these pets with a chance to meet new individuals who they may soon see as their family.
