<h1>Our Rescues</h1>
<p>Here are some of our pets we rescued from last year's recent hurricane, this is them now living comfortably with both old and new families.</p>

<h2><img src="../Pics/Jack.jpg" alt="Jack" width="220" height="174"><br>Jack</h2>
<p>Meet Jack, he is a seven year-old dobberman with an abundance of energy and excitement, albeit too much. Next to him is his 2 year-old son, Dale, both Father and Son enjoy frolicking the countryside, chasing squerrels, and playing around with each other. Jack was rescued from under a lampost during last year's hurricane, being trapped under the post during the storm gave him immense fear and panic, but as soon as the winds died down enough we were able to launch a quick rescue group to lift the post off of him and carry him back to the safety of one our medical centers, where he was immediately treated for a few bruises and cuts. Once the storm had passed he was returned to his loving family, who were overjoyed to see his well-being, especially young Dale, who was overwhelmed to see his Father well and alive.</p>

<h2><img src="../Pics/Edgar.jpg" alt="Edgar" width="220" height="179"><br>Edgar</h2>
<p>Here we have young Edgar relaxing himself in his favorite spot. Edgar is a three year old black and brown cat who enjoys sleeping during the day and purring all night. This adolescent was found in the inside one of the nearly flooded sewers after the storm had hit, fortunately he was discovered holding on tight to the middle of a sewer grating, allowing him to breath and hold on fast without taking in mass amounts of rainwater. Miraculously our volunteers were able to cut the grating and lift him out of the flooded sewer, he was then rushed to the medical center where he was treated for shock and hypothermia. After a few weeks in the center, Edgar was then placed in our adoption center where he was taken in by a sweet elderly couple who enjoy his consistent attention around the house, Edgar now lives in great comfort alongside his new family.

<h2><img src="../Pics/Cocoa.jpg" alt="Cocoa" width="220" height="179"><br>Cocoa</h2>
<p>This is Cocoa, a six year old parrot who has the ability to speak, he can speak some English words but he mostly enjoys yelling out his own name "Cocoa!". Cocoa was previously found entangled in a nearby palm tree after the storm ahd passed, he had a broken right wing and lost a lot of feathers due to the powerful gust of the winds. Luckily, a group of our best volunteers were able to untangle him and bring him over to our medical center. He made a full recovery of his broken wing and regrew all of his lost feathers. Now Cocoa lives in prime hospitality and comfort among his now grateful family who were quite anxious to have lost him before the storm.</p>
